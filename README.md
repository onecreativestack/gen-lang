## The new generation of web development

Even today, after almost 30 years, we still use JavaScript every day, but nowadays it is much more complicated than in the beginning and becomes more and more inaccessible for beginners. Even experienced developers can't keep up with the rapid development.
You should ask yourself why the whole thing is developing so rapidly.
On the one hand, the WWW is constantly growing and has never been more present in society.On the other hand, JavaScript is simply inconvenient and misused.
JavaScript is not a programming language designed to implement modern backends. Node gives us the possibility, but I like to say: "You can hammer a nail into the wall with a shovel, but there is also a hammer for that". But exactly this sentence doesn't work with JavaScript, because there is no suitable hammer for the nail.

I want to rethink all aspects of web programming as much as possible and make web programming more accessible This doesn't This doesn't mean that I just blindly want to do everything differently, but in some places it has to be different
